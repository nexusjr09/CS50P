#TYPES OF ERROR :

1) Syntax error ---> :,{}, when this gets missing this error pops up.
2) ValueError ---> When the data entered is not in expected format/datatype.
3) NameError --> A NameError in Python appears when you try to use a variable (or name) that hasnâ€™t been defined or assigned yet maybe because error comes before the value is assigned !
